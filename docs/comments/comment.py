dataScienceReviews = ['Very good course for beginners but should spend enough time on other topics to get familiar with all libraries and models. This course also needs to be updated with latest versions , libraries and models','The course was really great and provided good insights to python libraries. Few topics were covered in haste just for the sake of completing the course.','Not bad for complete entry level. Not a lot of theory and background math. But good for learning all the python tools' 'not satisfied', 'Just completed the course and I can confidently say that it is a great introduction to Data Science. Kirill puts a lot of order into chaos, while still leaving the students open to find individual and independent solutions. Daniel is also a great Q&A moderator. Great team, great course!']
dataScienceReviews1 = ['This is an amazing course, Kirill did a nice job here, especially the data preparation part, its very comprehensive.','The Q&A pages in the course are littered with people complaining that if you are using a Mac you are unable to install the required programs. This means you are not able to complete the third section of the course. Despite these complaints being months/years old, the creators of this course have still not updated the Requirements page. I find it incredibly misleading that the creators of the course are unwilling to make clear the hardware requirements of their course.','Did not specify this course is not compatible with Mac.', 'Not very practical.','NO Video, only audio, I have old XP computer, all other Udemy courses work fine.','poor buffering speed']
dataScienceReviews2 = ['Too much unnecessary talks, needs lot of editing to remove it. Probably 21 hours content be reduced to less than 10 hours. Hard to focus when you constantly have to filter out more than half of the things someone is saying','Expected more information like some lecture about hadoop, sparks etc. For getting data science required lots of knowledge about statistics as well as algorithms. Lot of things required to be added in this course so that anyone can apply for data science jobs. Thanks','This is the best course l have ever done, however l need the notes. where can l download them?','Good course, unfortunately they forgot to mention that the programs that about 1/4 of the course rely on are not available for mac.','In a number of occasions small things was explained repeated in a circle before moving on to the next point.']
