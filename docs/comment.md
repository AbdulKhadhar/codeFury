ML1 = ['Great start to Machine Learning! I would have liked it more if it had explained more Math behind the ML models.',
		'I personally feel that instructors know what you are going to face in real life what challenges you will face while working on any machine learning project , though udemy asked me to rate course very early and promoted multiple times in middle but i waited as i was enjoying course a lot and wanted to learn first and didnt want to leave a halfhearted rating i personally feeling reading references and links are very helpful , and this is a top-notch course to start .',
		'Amazing! This course helped me to implement a personal project, but i have two suggestions:I would like to see the same algorithms implemented with more complex data.2Â° "How to get the dataset" shouldnt show up every session.',
'Could be better, content not that good',
'Not satisfied with the course content',

ML2 = [
		'Very good course for beginners but should spend enough time on other topics to get familiar with all libraries and models. This course also needs to be updated with latest versions , libraries and models',
		'Excellent course that teaches the fundamental skills with Python and Data Science! Recommend for people trying to learn python without much prior experience. The program is complete with open ended projects that allow you to develop in the future.',
		'Jose knocks it out of the park again! My only criticism is There really needs to be more fundamental overview for math and data science to better grasp this stuff.',
		'Not that good',
		'It doesnt focus on beginners, its high level',

ML3 = [
		'Very good practical knowledge and intuitional explanations. It would be perfect to include some theoritical explanations too.',
		'Good one. Actually covered almost all theorem with theory and its practical examples.Good to start especially for someone who dont know anything about ML.',
		'Poor buffering speed',
		'Unsatisfactory',
		'Not much projects done',
