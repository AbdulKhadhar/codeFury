					<h5 class="card-title">Machine Learning</h5>
					<p class="card-text">Machine Learning is a system that can learn from example through self-improvement and
						without being explicitly coded by programmer. The breakthrough comes with the idea that a machine can
						singularly learn from the data (i.e., example) to produce accurate results.

						Machine learning combines data with statistical tools to predict an output. This output is then used by
						corporate to makes actionable insights. Machine learning is closely related to data mining and Bayesian
						predictive modeling. The machine receives data as input, use an algorithm to formulate answers.</p>
